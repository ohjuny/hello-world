# hello-world
An effort to learn about how Github works through its tutorial

Usually, this hello world repository is one that you do as your very first
on Github, but on my account, you may notice that it is actually the third.
There is a reason for this.

When I first came on Github, I didn't bother to do the tutorial because I
thought that I would just figure things out as I used it. But after I shared
my Monopoly_Simulator repository, a lot of people on Reddit and CodeReview
told me about the in-built version control feature on Github, and told me to
read up on its various features. That's why I'm creating this repository as
my third, not first, on Github.

Anyway, no one really cares about this, and I doubt that anyone is actually
going to read through this long-winded description of a hello-world repository,
so I'm just gonna end it now.

:D
